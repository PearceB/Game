Breakout

The project contained in this repository is a recreation of the game Breakout, created in 1976 and developed by Atari, Inc.

The basics:
	The game starts with the top third of the screen covered in bricks and a paddle on the lower part of the screen.
	Once the game is started, a ball appears on the screen. Every time the ball hits a brick, the ball is sent back in
	the opposite direction, and the brick disappears. The paddle can be moved to prevent the ball from hitting the
	lower end of the screen. If the ball hits the bottom of the screen, the game ends. Points are rewarded for each brick
	successfully hit.
